A/B testing, the WordPress way.

== Description ==

ShrimpTest is an A/B testing solution for WordPress under development at Automattic. This is a very very early development release and is not recommended for production use. For an introduction to this project, I invite you to read [Every blog has a purpose](http://shrimptest.wordpress.com/2010/06/01/every-website-has-a-purpose/).

Please visit the [ShrimpTest development blog](http://shrimptest.wordpress.com) to get an idea of the project's progress.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `shrimptest.zip` to your plugins directory ( usally `/wp-content/plugins/` )
2. Unzip the `shrimptest.zip` file
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. If you are using WP Super Cache, move the `shrimptest-supercache.php` file to the `plugins/wp-super-cache/plugins/` and make sure your WP Super Cache is in Half On mode. ShrimpTest support for WP Super Cache does not work if WP Super Cache is in Full On mode.
