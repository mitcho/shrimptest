A/B testing, the WordPress way.

== Description ==

ShrimpTest is an A/B testing solution for WordPress under development at Automattic. For an introduction to this project, I invite you to read [Every blog has a purpose](http://shrimptest.wordpress.com/2010/06/01/every-website-has-a-purpose/).

This version (1.0b1) is the feature-complete preview release. [Bug reports appreciated.](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/newticket?component=shrimptest)

== Installation ==

1. Upload `shrimptest.zip` to your plugins directory ( usally `/wp-content/plugins/` )
2. Unzip the `shrimptest.zip` file
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

= Caching support (WP Super Cache and W3 Total Cache) =

*If you are using WP Super Cache,* move the `shrimptest-cache-plugin.php` file to the `plugins/wp-super-cache/plugins/` and make sure your WP Super Cache is in Half On mode. ShrimpTest support for WP Super Cache does not work if WP Super Cache is in Full On mode.

*If you are using W3 Total Cache,* move the `shrimptest-cache-plugin.php` file to the `plugins/w3-total-cache/plugins/` and make sure W3 Total Cache's Page Cache is using the "Disk (basic)" method. ShrimpTest support will not work with the "Disk (enhanced)" method.

If you use any caching plugin without the ShrimpTest support, *your experiment results will be invalid.*
